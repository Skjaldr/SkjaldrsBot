#SkjaldrsBot
A bot that interacts between discord using / commands and sends input to the game client, executing certain spells and guild commands in game.

Still a work in progress, but the gist of the program is that the program asks for the users Discord Token, and requests the path name for the sb executable.  The bot listens to discord chat for specific commands: /sum or /evac for summon, /tags or /inv for guild inv, and eventually added funcitonality to call for buffs, prompting the bot to invite the user to their group and provides buffs (priest, doomy, etc.
 Eventually there will also be added functionality for a UI that does everything formerly listed.



*Funcitonality needed*
This is not an exhaustive list:

* Menu to choose options
* Script to allow/change Copy/Paste settings into CMD prompt or Powershell
* Add buff functionality to window_handler
* Add buffs to discord command list for in game buffs
* Implement GUI
