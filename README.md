#SkjaldrsBot
A bot that interacts between discord using / commands and sends input game client executing certain spells and guild commands

Still a work in progress, but the gist of the program is that the program asks for the users Discord Token, and requests the path name for the sb executable.  The bot listens to discord chat for specific commands: /sum or /evac for summon, /tags or /inv for guild inv, and eventually added funcitonality to call for buffs, prompting the bot to invite the user to their group and provides buffs (priest, doomy, etc).  Eventually there will also be added functionality for a UI that does everything formerly listed.
