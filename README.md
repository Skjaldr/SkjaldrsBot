#SkjaldrsBot
A bot that interacts between discord using / commands and sends input to the game client, executing certain spells and guild commands in game.

This is still a work in progress, but the program asks for the users Discord Token,requests the path name for the sb executable, and stores them in a locally generated config file..  The discord portion of the bot listens to discord chat for specific commands: /sum or /evac for summon, /tags or /inv for guild inv. Eventually funcitonality to call for buffs will be added, prompting the shadowbane bot portion to invite the user to their group and provides buffs (priest, doomy, etc).
 Eventually there will also be added functionality for a UI that does everything formerly listed.



*Funcitonality needed*
This is not an exhaustive list:

* Menu to choose options
* Script to allow/change Copy/Paste settings into CMD prompt or Powershell
* Add buff functionality to window_handler
* Add buffs to discord command list for in game buffs
* Implement GUI
